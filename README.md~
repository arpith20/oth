ONLINE TREASURE HUNT ENGINE
<pre>
Please note:
To edit server/database details, modify config.php
The files are named as follows:
	<t/>If the file name is *.php, then * represents the answer of the previous level
	<t/>First file is named start.php and is accessible even without registering (preview)
respawn.php will take the user to the last played level. (this is useful in case of browser crash or connection loss)
All images are saved in a folder named "img"

Fell free to contribute to this project

Cheers!!
