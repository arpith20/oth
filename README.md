ONLINE TREASURE HUNT ENGINE
===========================

Please note:
-----------
To edit server/database details, modify config.php<br/>
The files are named as follows:<br/>
	<t/>If the file name is *.php, then * represents the answer of the previous level<br/>
	<t/>First file is named start.php and is accessible even without registering (preview)<br/>
respawn.php will take the user to the last played level. (this is useful in case of browser crash or connection loss)<br/>
All images are saved in a folder named "img"<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to contribute to this project<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!!
